I am a graduate researcher in computer engineering at Purdue University. My research interests include computer network systems, programmable switches, and caching. My paper recently accepted to NSDI '24 enables future-aware caching on network processors using a future packet notification scheme. You can view my presentation on it at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7eJpXIJiGM. Feel free to ask me anything!
