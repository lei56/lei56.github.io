I am a graduate researcher in computer engineering at Purdue University. My research interests include computer network systems, programmable switches, and caching. My paper recently accepted to NSDI '24 enables future-aware caching on network processors using a future packet notification scheme. You can read it for free [here](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi24/presentation/lei) or view my presentation on it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7eJpXIJiGM). Feel free to ask me anything!
