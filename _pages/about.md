I am a graduate researcher in computer engineering at Purdue University. My research interests typically lie in the field of computer networks, in particular programmable switches. I am currently working on a paper implementing a new packet communication primitive that allows data to be exchanged between network switches with practically 0 throughput overhead. Feel free to ask me anything!
